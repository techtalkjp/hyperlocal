  "content": "# Enjoying Solo Dining in Shinjuku\n\nEven in bustling Shinjuku, there are numerous restaurants where you can comfortably enjoy a meal alone. We'll introduce establishments where you can truly value your personal time, whether it's a pleasant hour at a counter seat or soaking in the warm ambiance of a long-standing eatery.\n\n## A Hidden Gem Izakaya in Shinjuku West Exit\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJQw5sjEeNGGARr0BPgy1qksw\" />\nThis izakaya, tucked away a short walk from Shinjuku Station's West Exit, boasts a hidden-gem atmosphere. With its Japanese-style interior featuring natural wood, the counter seats surrounding the kitchen are perfect for solo diners. A delightful touch is being able to choose your favorite chopstick rest from a wide selection when you're seated. The menu, which changes monthly to feature seasonal ingredients, promises new culinary discoveries with every visit. Their famous \"Honki no Ajifry\" (Serious Fried Horse Mackerel) is a masterpiece: fresh horse mackerel, suitable for sashimi, is perfectly fried to be rare inside and crispy outside. Dishes like potato salad made with potatoes simmered in oden broth, Wagyu Yukke, and beef tongue all showcase exceptional culinary skill and flavor. The live, dynamic atmosphere at the counter makes it a charming spot where solo diners can feel completely at ease.\n\n## Long-Established Motsuyaki in Omoide Yokocho\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJDXX7JG6NGGARwENQK5p69iU\" />\nEstablished in 1947, this venerable motsuyaki (grilled offal) restaurant is a cornerstone of Omoide Yokocho. It's a feast for the eyes, with motsu stew simmering gently in a large pot and fresh offal lined up next to blocks of ice. The space is incredibly narrow, with counter seating only, but that very atmosphere is its greatest charm. The melt-in-your-mouth stew has no unpleasant odor and condenses the unique umami of offal. All the grilled skewers are cooked to perfection—whether you order liver, shiro (large intestine), hatsu (heart), or tan (tongue), you can't go wrong. There's no menu; you simply entrust your order to the staff. It’s a precious establishment, preserving a 昭和 (Showa-era) atmosphere, where you can quickly enjoy your meal and depart within about an hour. It's a hidden gem in Shinjuku, perfect for a solo visit.\n\n## Spice Curry in an Alleyway\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJ8Se7ZdaNGGARyBoMuokkm-Q\" />\nThis specialty spice curry shop quietly resides on the 3rd floor, hidden up a staircase behind a shutter in an alleyway near Shinjuku West Exit. Contrary to its unassuming exterior, the interior is surprisingly spacious and features counter seating, making it welcoming for solo diners. You can enjoy two daily changing curries with different levels of spiciness, and the combination with cheese kulcha (naan filled with cheese) is exquisite. Each curry is meticulously prepared, from the chicken curry with its superb balance of richness, umami, and spices, to the gently flavored masoor dal and spinach curry. The cheese kulcha, generously stuffed with gooey cheese, is addictively delicious. This place comes highly recommended for those who want to savor spice curry leisurely on their own.\n\n## Enjoying Comfortable Solo Time in Shinjuku\n\nWhether it's the counter of a hidden izakaya, the warm ambiance of a long-established motsuyaki spot, or a spice curry shop tucked away in an alleyway, Shinjuku offers a plethora of establishments where you can comfortably spend time alone. Why not treat yourself to such a luxurious solo experience, savoring delicious food and drinks at your own pace?",
