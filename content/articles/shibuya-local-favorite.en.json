  "content": "# Shibuya: Hidden Gems Loved by Locals\n\nWhile Shibuya thrives as a lively hub for young people, venture a little deeper and you'll discover tranquil, renowned eateries where locals go about their daily lives. Let's explore these establishments, cherished by adults who know the true Shibuya, far from the hustle and bustle of the commercial district.\n\n## Innovative Japanese Cuisine Woven with Fermentation and Wood-Fired Cooking\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJwxo5mQyNGGARGlfFnIn56ek\" />\nTucked away in a multi-tenant building behind Shibuya Police Station, this innovative Japanese restaurant was hailed as one of Tokyo's best in 2023. Chef Kunii, a mere 27 years old, showcases incredible spirit and flair, challenging traditional fermentation techniques and wood-fired cooking. The masterful plasterwork on the counter and walls, combined with the flickering flames of the wood fire, creates an otherworldly ambiance. You'll be impressed by his creativity, like describing his homemade cypress leaf pepper as a \"forest bath,\" and above all, by the robust flavors and exceptional cooking techniques and flavor combinations that set it apart. It's truly astonishing how such a refined space has been crafted amidst the vibrant chaos of Shibuya.\n\n## A Legendary Yakitori Spot Founded in 1932, Visited Even by Prime Ministers\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJ9ffsnneLGGAR5jSJwgBXUO8\" />\nNestled in a residential area of Shibuya, this venerable yakitori restaurant was established in 1932. Starting as a humble stall, this tiny two-story, two-tsubo (approx. 6.6 sq m) shop is now steeped in dreams and history, even secretly frequented by prime ministers. They serve delicious, traditional yakitori, cooked perfectly to maximize the savory umami of the chicken. The sauce is a classic, with a pleasant sweetness and a hint of alcohol; the chicken skin is particularly recommended with it. While reservations are a must for this popular spot, calling at 11 AM might sometimes secure a same-day table. Both the exterior and interior exude the charm of a bygone era's yakitori joint, and the ability to enjoy a satisfying meal in around 40 minutes is another draw.\n\n## A Hidden Yakitori Gem in Oku-Shibuya (Deep Shibuya)\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJYS0Kb1qLGGARgjyZa8cfFr4\" />\nAbout a 10-minute walk from Shibuya Station, tucked away in a residential area, lies this elusive yakitori restaurant where reservations are notoriously difficult to secure. Each skewer, crafted from four varieties of local chicken, boasts top-class freshness and flavor. The fresh chicken liver, in particular, is served lightly grilled with a rich, intense taste. Share a recommended bottle of wine from the quiet and kind owner as you savor each skewer, served at a perfect pace. The pleasant service, the owner's movements, and the quality of every skewer are undeniably excellent, and the L-shaped counter creates a unique atmosphere conducive to conversation. Even the final dish, chicken soba, will impress you with its clear soup and rich chicken broth, truly justifying its reputation as a difficult-to-book masterpiece.\n\n## Local Italian in Sakuragaoka-cho\n\n<Place id=\"ChIJxX0txlCLGGARCLDKN-s51ko\" />\nA short walk from Shibuya Station, in Sakuragaoka-cho, you'll find this Italian bistro beloved by locals. Situated in a quiet area away from the station, it offers a relaxed atmosphere for dining. With both an L-shaped counter and table seating, the space is comfortable and inviting. Lunch starts from an affordable 1,200 yen, and the dishes, which highlight the natural flavors of the ingredients, are both profound and impressive. Everything on the menu is delicious, with the pasta's al dente texture and the balance of saltiness being particularly exquisite. This high-quality establishment is also recommended for a casual date.\n\n## Exploring Shibuya's True Face: A Tour of Esteemed Establishments for Adults\n\nFrom long-standing establishments with over 90 years of history to innovative restaurants led by young chefs, Shibuya is home to numerous esteemed places cherished by locals, often unknown to tourists.
